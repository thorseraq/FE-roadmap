### Indicate a directory as a TypeScript project.
ðŸ“« link: [What is a tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)<br/>

A tsconfig.json file or xxx.json in the current directory or parent directory can be recognized by TypeScript cli - [**tsc**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html#tsc-the-typescript-compiler). 

### How TypeScirpt project is structured using import/export: 
ðŸ“« link: [Modules](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html)<br/>
TypeScript implements an ECMAScript 2015(ES6) style module-loading systems, and is capable of compiling the project to various module-loading system, such as Node.js (CommonJS), require.js (AMD), UMD, SystemJS or ECMAScript 2015 native modules (ES6) . This can be configured by [module](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#module) in the tsconfig.json file. Therefore, in TypeScript project there is no need worrying about the target platform where compiled javascript files are running, as different platforms may require different module system.

âš¡ example: cnofiguring the target module-loading system
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs"
  }
}
```

### How typescript module system resolves module path
ðŸ“« link: [Module Resolution](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html)<br/>

There are two types of paths when `import {SomeClass} from "some_path_is_put_here"`: Relative path and Non-relative path. When resolving there two kinds of paths, two strategies are used, Classic(for backwards compatibility) and Node(recommended). These two are similar. Very detailed examples are showed in above article. [baseUrl](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#baseUrl) and [paths](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths) can be configured to impact non-relative path resolving. Note once path is configured to imply path mapping, non-relative resolving rule will be breaked. Examples in [Path-mapping](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#path-mapping) shows this.
